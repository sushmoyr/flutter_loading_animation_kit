  /// Saves a copy of the current transform and clip on the save stack, and then

  /// save stack is later popped, the group will be flattened into a layer and
  /// have the given `paint`'s [Paint.colorFilter] and [Paint.blendMode]
  /// applied.
  ///
  /// This lets you create composite effects, for example making a group of
  /// drawing commands semi-transparent. Without using [saveLayer], each part of
  /// the group would be painted individually, so where they overlap would be
  /// darker than where they do not. By using [saveLayer] to group them
  /// together, they can be drawn with an opaque color at first, and then the
  /// entire group can be made transparent using the [saveLayer]'s paint.
  ///
  /// Call [restore] to pop the save stack and apply the paint to the group.
  ///
  /// ## Using saveLayer with clips
  ///
  /// When a rectangular clip operation (from [clipRect]) is not axis-aligned
  /// with the raster buffer, or when the clip operation is not rectilinear
  /// (e.g. because it is a rounded rectangle clip created by [clipRRect] or an
  /// arbitrarily complicated path clip created by [clipPath]), the edge of the
  /// clip needs to be anti-aliased.
  ///
  /// If two draw calls overlap at the edge of such a clipped region, without
  /// using [saveLayer], the first drawing will be anti-aliased with the
  /// background first, and then the second will be anti-aliased with the result
  /// of blending the first drawing and the background. On the other hand, if
  /// [saveLayer] is used immediately after establishing the clip, the second
  /// drawing will cover the first in the layer, and thus the second alone will
  /// be anti-aliased with the background when the layer is clipped and
  /// composited (when [restore] is called).
  ///
  /// For example, this [CustomPainter.paint] method paints a clean white
  /// rounded rectangle:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  ///   Rect rect = Offset.zero & size;
  ///   canvas.save();
  ///   canvas.clipRRect(RRect.fromRectXY(rect, 100.0, 100.0));
  ///   canvas.saveLayer(rect, Paint());
  ///   canvas.drawPaint(Paint()..color = Colors.red);
  ///   canvas.drawPaint(Paint()..color = Colors.white);
  ///   canvas.restore();
  ///   canvas.restore();
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// On the other hand, this one renders a red outline, the result of the red
  /// paint being anti-aliased with the background at the clip edge, then the
  /// white paint being similarly anti-aliased with the background _including
  /// the clipped red paint_:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  ///   // (this example renders poorly, prefer the example above)
  ///   Rect rect = Offset.zero & size;
  ///   canvas.save();
  ///   canvas.clipRRect(RRect.fromRectXY(rect, 100.0, 100.0));
  ///   canvas.drawPaint(Paint()..color = Colors.red);
  ///   canvas.drawPaint(Paint()..color = Colors.white);
  ///   canvas.restore();
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This point is moot if the clip only clips one draw operation. For example,
  /// the following paint method paints a pair of clean white rounded
  /// rectangles, even though the clips are not done on a separate layer:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  ///   canvas.save();
  ///   canvas.clipRRect(RRect.fromRectXY(Offset.zero & (size / 2.0), 50.0, 50.0));
  ///   canvas.drawPaint(Paint()..color = Colors.white);
  ///   canvas.restore();
  ///   canvas.save();
  ///   canvas.clipRRect(RRect.fromRectXY(size.center(Offset.zero) & (size / 2.0), 50.0, 50.0));
  ///   canvas.drawPaint(Paint()..color = Colors.white);
  ///   canvas.restore();
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// (Incidentally, rather than using [clipRRect] and [drawPaint] to draw
  /// rounded rectangles like this, prefer the [drawRRect] method. These
  /// examples are using [drawPaint] as a proxy for "complicated draw operations
  /// that will get clipped", to illustrate the point.)
  ///
  /// ## Performance considerations
  ///
  /// Generally speaking, [saveLayer] is relatively expensive.
  ///
  /// There are a several different hardware architectures for GPUs (graphics
  /// processing units, the hardware that handles graphics), but most of them
  /// involve batching commands and reordering them for performance. When layers
  /// are used, they cause the rendering pipeline to have to switch render
  /// target (from one layer to another). Render target switches can flush the
  /// GPU's command buffer, which typically means that optimizations that one
  /// could get with larger batching are lost. Render target switches also
  /// generate a lot of memory churn because the GPU needs to copy out the
  /// current frame buffer contents from the part of memory that's optimized for
  /// writing, and then needs to copy it back in once the previous render target
  /// (layer) is restored.
  ///
  /// See also:
  ///
  ///  * [save], which saves the current state, but does not create a new layer
  ///    for subsequent commands.

  /// color will be considered the destination.
  /// - Blend the result from the first step onto the canvas using the translation,
  /// rotation, and scale properties expressed in the associated entry in the
  /// [transforms] list using the properties of the [Paint] object.
  ///
  /// If the first stage of the operation which blends each part of the image with
  /// a color is needed, then both the [colors] and [blendMode] arguments must
  /// not be null and there must be an entry in the [colors] list for each
  /// image part. If that stage is not needed, then the [colors] argument can
  /// be either null or an empty list and the [blendMode] argument may also be null.
  ///

  /// Draws many parts of an image - the [atlas] - onto the canvas.
  ///
  /// This method allows for optimization when you want to draw many parts of an
  /// image onto the canvas, such as when using sprites or zooming. It is more efficient
  /// than using multiple calls to [drawImageRect] and provides more functionality
  /// to individually transform each image part by a separate rotation or scale and
  /// blend or modulate those parts with a solid color. It is also more efficient
  /// than [drawAtlas] as the data in the arguments is already packed in a format
  /// that can be directly used by the rendering code.
  ///
  /// A full description of how this method uses its arguments to draw onto the
  /// canvas can be found in the description of the [drawAtlas] method.
  ///
  /// The [rstTransforms] argument is interpreted as a list of four-tuples, with
  /// each tuple being ([RSTransform.scos], [RSTransform.ssin],
  /// [RSTransform.tx], [RSTransform.ty]).
  ///
  /// The [rects] argument is interpreted as a list of four-tuples, with each
  /// tuple being ([Rect.left], [Rect.top], [Rect.right], [Rect.bottom]).
  ///
  /// The [colors] argument, which can be null, is interpreted as a list of
  /// 32-bit colors, with the same packing as [Color.value]. If the [colors]
  /// argument is not null then the [blendMode] argument must also not be null.
  ///
  /// An example usage to render many sprites from a single sprite atlas with no rotations
  /// or scales:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// class Sprite {
  ///   int index;
  ///   double centerX;
  ///   double centerY;
  /// }
  ///
  /// class MyPainter extends CustomPainter {
  ///   // assume spriteAtlas contains N 10x10 sprites side by side in a (N*10)x10 image
  ///   ui.Image spriteAtlas;
  ///   List<Sprite> allSprites;
  ///
  ///   @override
  ///   void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  ///     // For best advantage, these lists should be cached and only specific
  ///     // entries updated when the sprite information changes. This code is
  ///     // illustrative of how to set up the data and not a recommendation for
  ///     // optimal usage.
  ///     Float32List rectList = Float32List(allSprites.length * 4);
  ///     Float32List transformList = Float32List(allSprites.length * 4);
  ///     for (int i = 0; i < allSprites.length; i++) {
  ///       final double rectX = sprite.spriteIndex * 10.0;
  ///       rectList[i * 4 + 0] = rectX;
  ///       rectList[i * 4 + 1] = 0.0;
  ///       rectList[i * 4 + 2] = rectX + 10.0;
  ///       rectList[i * 4 + 3] = 10.0;
  ///
  ///       // This example sets the RSTransform values directly for a common case of no
  ///       // rotations or scales and just a translation to position the atlas entry. For
  ///       // more complicated transforms one could use the RSTransform class to compute
  ///       // the necessary values or do the same math directly.
  ///       transformList[i * 4 + 0] = 1.0;
  ///       transformList[i * 4 + 1] = 0.0;
  ///       transformList[i * 4 + 2] = sprite.centerX - 5.0;
  ///       transformList[i * 4 + 3] = sprite.centerY - 5.0;
  ///     }

  ///       // This example computes the color value directly, but one could also compute
